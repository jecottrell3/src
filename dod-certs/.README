* Importing DOD Root and Intermediate Certificates

Every so often, certificates expire, and new certs are issued by
DISA. These must be Downloaded, Formatted, and Imported into the RHEL
Certificate Database, which lives in /etc/pki/nssdb. The command to do
this is "certutil".

This directory uses two of my own personal ideosyncrasies:

[1] Stuff I care about are in hidden files, beginning with a period.
    Everything else is ephemeral, and can be erased with "rm *".
[2] Some of the scripts generate scripts, or output a command to manually run.

Everything is controled by running "./.make", which is actually an
executable Makefile.

* STEPS

The target "help" is the default, and provides a reminder of other targets.
The target "all" is the main line, and does the steps listed below. Because
this is a Makefile, the steps are named after the targets that are built, not
the action.

[1] zip   -- downloads the DOD Cert Bundle Zip File from DISA
[2] dir   -- unpacks the Bundle into its own driectory
[3] pems  -- unpacks a PKCS7 Bundle into a bundle of PEM Certs
[4] split -- splits each Cert into its own file
[5] add   -- builds a command file named "add" which must be run separately
             Also builds a file named "del" which deletes certs.

* OTHER TARGETS

+ list  -- lists the database.
+ del   -- deletes the certs that "add" added
+ clean -- removes ephemeral files.
+ save  -- saves   ephemeral files.
+ rest  -- restore ephemeral files.
+ INIT  -- DANGEROUS! Starts with a New Empty Database.
+ NUKE  -- DANGEROUS! Removes all certs in the database.

* HELPERS

.make  -- the executable Makefile that runs everything.
.split -- splits the pkcs7 bundle into a pem bundle
.add   -- builds the "add" and "del" scripts. These must be run by hand,
          typically via "sudo sh -x add".
.nuke  -- removes any and all certs in the database.
.save  -- a directory to save ephemeral files into

* THEORY

The NSS Database is managed by the "certutil" command. It has many options,
but most people only use a few. The -d option specifies the directory as
well as the format, e.g. -d dbm:/etc/pki/nssdb or -d sql:/somewhere/else.

Certutil supports two types of databases: the legacy security databases
(cert8.db, key3.db, and secmod.db) and new SQLite databases (cert9.db,
key4.db, and pkcs11.txt).

These scripts manage both in parallel, altho probably only one is necessary.

A format:directory option needs to be specified for every command.

Certs are added with the -A option. Use -i file to specify a file,
-a to specify ASCII format, and -n name to specify a name. A Trust string
also needs to be specified, and always seems to be -t CT,C,C. As usual, the

Certs can be deleted with -D, and specifying which name with -n.

The -L option lists all certs of a certain type in a directory, e.g.
certutil -L -d $format:$dir. A specific cert can be listed by specifying
-n name, optionally with -a.

A new database can be created with -N. Use an empty password.

See the generated files "add" and "del" for more info.
