* Importing DOD Root and Intermediate Certificates

Every so often, certificates expire, and new certs are issued by
DISA. These must be Downloaded, Formatted, and Imported into the RHEL
Certificate Database, which lives in /etc/pki/nssdb. The command to do
this is "certutil".

This directory uses two of my own personal ideosyncrasies:

[1] Stuff I care about are in hidden files, beginning with a period.
    Everything else is ephemeral, and can be erased with "rm *".
[2] Some of the scripts generate scripts, or output a command to manually run.

Everything is controled by running "./.make", which is actually an
executable Makefile. Aliasing "make" to "./.make" might be a good idea.

* STEPS

The target "help" is the default, and provides a reminder of other targets.
The target "all" is the main line, and does the steps listed below. Because
this is a Makefile, the steps are named after the targets that are built, not
the action.

These first 4 steps can be run as any user, and only change the local dir

[1] get     -- Downloads the DOD Cert Bundle File et al
[2] cvt     -- Unpacks a PKCS7 Bundle into a bundle of PEM Certs
[3] split   -- Splits each Cert into its own file
[4] add     -- Builds a command file named "add" which must be run separately
               Also builds a file named "del" which deletes certs.
[5] all     -- Does the above steps.

The following steps actually Install the certs into /etc/pki/nssdb

[1] save    -- Saves a copy of the existing NSSDB
[2] init    -- Initialize empty NSSDB
[3] fix     -- Fix SELinux Context and File Permissions
[4] install -- Adds certs to NSSDB and fixes selinux and permissions 

* OTHER TARGETS, mostly not used

+ list  -- lists the database.
+ clean -- removes ephemeral files.
+ del   -- deletes the certs that "add" added

* HELPERS

.make   -- the executable Makefile that runs everything.
.split  -- splits the pkcs7 bundle into a pem bundle
.add    -- builds the "add" and "del" scripts. These must be run by hand,
           typically via "sudo sh -x add".
.nuke   -- removes any and all certs in the database.
.import -- replacement for /usr/local/sbin/import_certs

* THEORY

The NSS Database is managed by the "certutil" command. It has many options,
but most people only use a few. The -d option specifies the directory as
well as the format, e.g. -d dbm:/etc/pki/nssdb or -d sql:/somewhere/else.

Certutil supports two types of databases: the legacy security databases
(cert8.db, key3.db, and secmod.db) and new SQLite databases (cert9.db,
key4.db, and pkcs11.txt).

A format:directory option needs to be specified for every command.

These scripts manage both in parallel, altho probably only one is necessary.

Certs are added with the -A option. Use -i file to specify a file,
-a to specify ASCII format, and -n name to specify a name. A Trust string
also needs to be specified, and always seems to be -t CT,C,C.

Certs can be deleted with -D, and specifying which name with -n.

The -L option lists all certs of a certain type in a directory, e.g.
certutil -L -d $format:$dir. A specific cert can be listed in detail by
specifying -n name, optionally with -a.

A new database can be created with -N. Use an empty password.

See the generated files "add" and "del" for more info.

NOTE: the certutil -A command seems to always generate the following error:

certutil: could not authenticate to token NSS Certificate DB.:
SEC_ERROR_IO: An I/O error occurred during security authorization.

These can be safely ignored.
